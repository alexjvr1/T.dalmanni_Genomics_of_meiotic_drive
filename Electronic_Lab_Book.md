# Analyses

This electronic lab book serves as: 

1) A record of the decisions made during data processing and analysis

2) A clear record of the analyses including links to data, scripts, and final outputs

# 1. Genome assembly

## 1a. ST genome assembly

### Data

Two sets of HiFi reads were generated from pooled larvae which were inbred for X (IBD) but not the autosomes. Individuals were all female, thus we expect no difference in coverage between the X chromosome and autosomes. 


### HiFiasm

#### De novo assembly

Each set of raw reads was submitted to HiFiasm for de novo assembly using [HiFiasm_INPUT1](https://github.com/alexjvr1/T.dalmanni_Genomics_of_meiotic_drive/blob/main/Scripts/Genome_Assembly/STgenome/HiFiasm_INPUT1.sh) and [HiFiasm_INPUT2](https://github.com/alexjvr1/T.dalmanni_Genomics_of_meiotic_drive/blob/main/Scripts/Genome_Assembly/STgenome/HiFiasm_INPUT2.sh)
