# Analyses

A step-by-step description of the analyses conducted as a detailed supplement to the manuscript. 

In the spirit of open and repeatable science, we provide a cleaned-up version of my electronic notebook. This serves as: 

1) A record of the decisions made during data processing and analysis

2) A clear guide to rerunning analyses using the same data

3) Scripts and guide to updating results as new data becomes available

Feel free to modify and use in tutorials or in your own analyses. I would be grateful for an acknowledgement, but don't expect it.
